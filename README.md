III. Topics
This course is about design and applications of mobile robots. The course content
includes theoretical lectures and hands on experimental work. In the lectures, basic
theory about mobile robot will be covered. In the experimental part, students will apply
the learned theory to build a mobile robot, which will be used for the final robot contest.
The topics include DC motor and motion control , robotic sensors and interfacing, robot
locomotion and behavior based programming . H ands on practices will be carried out in
an organized manner using the constructed robot . A t t he final stage of the course, each
and every student team will complete a robot for the final robot hockey contest. All the
material s will be supplied in the class . The students will build the robot and develop the
necessary programs gradually for the final contest . A term project will be assigned for
each team to present a robot show by using the same robot hardware, but with extra
perception sensors. The major chapters includ e:
1. Introduction
2. Embedded computing platform and ROS programming environment
3. DC motor control, mobile robot motion control
4. Robot sensors
5. Mobile robot mechanism
6. Behavior based control design
7. Behavior Fusion
8. Localization
9. Obstacle avoidance
10. Robot hockey contest inclu ding 4 hands on assignments
