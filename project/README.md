1.	Topic
Domestic tourism has been increasing due to Covid-19. In this way, the highway traffic becomes much heavier. ACC(Adaptive Cruise Control), which can measure the distance among vehicles with radar and ensure stabilized speed during the long-distance-driving. As a result, ACC may reduce drivers’ fatigue. I’d like to transfer the radar sensor in ACC into a camera sensor, and make robot recognize shapes with camera by opencv. At the end, I hope the robot may follow the shape which is the sign of safe movement.
2.	Process
Draw a triangle with a thick border on the paper, use one or two camera on the robot to recognize graphics. Measure the distance and location.  When moving the graphic, the robot will follow or turn.
